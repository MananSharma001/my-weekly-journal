      <h1>About Journal Hub</h1>
      <p>Hello! I’m an international student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia. Having embarked on this exciting journey, I’m passionate about exploring new cultures, building connections, and diving deep into the world of technology. This weekly journal is my personal space to document and share the significant milestones and experiences that shape my life as a student abroad.</p>

<p>Here, you’ll find regular updates on major events—be it academic achievements, cultural discoveries, or memorable moments with friends. From attending university events to exploring Melbourne’s vibrant community, I’ll be pushing updates to reflect my growth, challenges, and adventures. Join me on this journey as I navigate life, studies, and the ever-evolving tech landscape!</p>
